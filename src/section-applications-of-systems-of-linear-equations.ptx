  <title>Applications of Systems of Linear Equations</title>
  <introduction>
    <p>
      <xref ref="example-system-of-equations-elimination-intro" />
      below is an example of how a system of linear equations can be used to solve an application problem.
      In this section,
      we will look at several types of application problems that can be solved using a system of linear equations,
      while giving you some strategies for solving these problems.
    </p>
  <example xml:id="example-system-of-equations-elimination-intro">
    <p>
      Alicia has <m>\$1000</m> to give to her two grandchildren for New Year's.
      She would like to give the older grandchild <m>\$120</m> more than the younger grandchild,
      because that is the cost of the older grandchild's college textbooks this term.
      How much money should she give to each grandchild?
    </p>
    <p>
      As always, we start solving a word problem by defining the variables,
      including their units.
      Let <m>A</m> be the dollar amount she gives to her older grandchild,
      and <m>B</m> be the dollar amount she gives to her younger grandchild.
      Since the total she has to give is <m>\$1000</m>,
      we can say that <m>A+B=1000</m>.
      Since she wants to give <m>\$120</m> more to the older grandchild,
      we can say that the difference between the amounts is <m>\$120</m>,
      or translated as a linear equation, <m>A-B=120</m>.
      This gives us two linear equations,
      which together makes a system of linear equations:
      <md>
        <mrow>\left\{ \begin{aligned} A+B \amp = 1000 \\ A-B \amp = 120 \end{aligned} \right.</mrow>
      </md>
    </p>
    <p>
      We can solve this system by either substitution as we learned in <xref ref="section-substitution" />
      or by elimination as we learned in <xref ref="section-elimination" />.
      Notice that if we add together the <em>left</em>
      sides from the two equations,
      the variable <m>B</m> will be eliminated quite easily:
      <md>
        <mrow>\begin{aligned}A+B\\{}+A-B\end{aligned}\amp=\begin{aligned}1000\\{}+120\end{aligned}</mrow>
        <intertext>So we have:</intertext>
        <mrow>2A\amp=1120</mrow>
      </md>
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus, the elimination method is an easy method to use and it doesn't take much to finish solving for <m>A</m>:
      <md>
        <mrow>2A\amp=1120</mrow>
 <!-- <mrow>\divideunder{2A}{2}\amp=\divideunder{1120}{2}</mrow> -->
        <mrow>A\amp=560</mrow>
      </md>
    </p>
    <p>
      To finish solving this system of equations,
      we need the value of <m>B</m>.
      For now, an easy way to find <m>B</m> is to substitute in our value of <m>A</m> into one of the original equations:
      <md>
        <mrow>A+B\amp=1000</mrow>
        <mrow>\substitute{560}+B\amp=1000</mrow>
 <!-- <mrow>560+B\subtractright{560}\amp=1000\subtractright{560}</mrow> -->
        <mrow>B\amp=440</mrow>
      </md>
      To check our work,
      substitute <m>A=560</m> and <m>B=440</m> into the original equations:
      <md>
        <mrow>A+B\amp=1000\amp A-B\amp=120</mrow>
        <mrow>\substitute{560}+\substitute{440}\amp\stackrel{?}{=}1000\amp \substitute{560}-\substitute{440}\amp\stackrel{?}{=}120</mrow>
        <mrow>1000\amp\stackrel{\checkmark}{=}1000\amp 120\amp\stackrel{\checkmark}{=}120</mrow>
      </md>
    </p>
    <p>
      This confirms that our solution is correct.
      In summary, Alicia should give <m>\$560</m> to her older grandchild and <m>\$440</m> to her younger grandchild.

    <title>Translating to a System of Equations</title>
    <p>
      Many times the challenge of solving application problems is being able to translate the situations into algebraic equations.
      When trying to solve application problems using systems of equations,
      students often make the mistake of trying to combine the two separate relationships that are present in the situation.
      The key is to determine what the
      <em>two separate</em> relationships are and then to keep in mind that these <em>two</em>
      relationships will be the basis of the <em>two</em>
      equations that will make up your system.
    </p>
    <p>
      Let's look at a couple of examples,
      where we will simply translate each problem into a system of linear equations,
      using steps 1-4 from the list of strategies above.
      We will not worry about solving these problems.
    </p>
    <example>
      <p>
        Translate to a system of equations:  		A married couple together earns $110,000 a year.
        The wife earns $16,000 less than twice what her husband earns.
        What does the husband earn?
        What does the wife earn?
      </p>
      <p>
        Here, we'll use steps 1-4 from the list of strategies given above.
      </p>
      <p><dl>
        <li>
          <title>Step 1:</title><p>Read the problem.
            Make sure you understand all the words and ideas.
          </p>
          <p>
            This is a problem relating the annual salaries of two people.
          </p>
          <p>
            Together they make a total of $110,000 annually and the wife makes $16,000 less than two times the husband's salary.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <title>Step 2:</title><p>Identify what you are looking for.
          </p>
          <p>
            "What does the husband earn?
            What does the wife earn?"
          </p>
          <p>
            We need to find how much the husband earns and how much the wife earns,
            per year.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <title>Step 3:</title><p>Name what you are looking for by choosing variables to represent those quantities.
          </p>
          <p>
            We will use two variables, <m>h</m> and <m>w</m>.
          </p>
          <p>
            Let <m>h</m> represent the husband's annual salary, in dollars,
            and let <m>w</m> represent the wife's annual salary, in dollars.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <title>Step 4:</title><p>Translate into a system of equations.
          </p>
          <p>
            We will write one equation for each sentence.
          </p>
          <p>
            <me>
              \underbrace{\text{Together their total annual salary }}_{h+w}\underbrace{\text{is}}_{=}\underbrace{\text{\$110,000}}_{110000}

              \underbrace{\text{The wife's annual salary}}_{w}\underbrace{\text{is}}_{=}\underbrace{\text{\$16,000 less than 2 times the husband's salary}}_{2h-16000}
            </me>
            <me>
              \text{Here is our system of equations:}
            </me>
            <me>
              \left\{ \begin{alignedat}{4} h {}+{}  w {}={} 110000 \\ w {}={} 2h {}-{} 16000 \end{alignedat} \right.
            </me>
          </p>
        </li>
      </dl></p>
    </example>
    <example>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Translate to a system of equations:  		Randall has 125 feet of fencing to enclose a rectangular portion of his backyard adjacent to his house.
          He will only need to fence around three sides because the fourth side will be the wall of his house.
          He wants the length of the fenced yard
          (parallel to the house wall)
          to be 5 feet more than four times as long as the width.
          Find the length and the width.
        </p>
      </statement>
      <solution>
        <p>
          Again, we'll use the same steps 1-4 from the list of strategies that we used in the last example.

              It will take a total of 125 feet of fencing to fence two widths and one length of the rectangular yard.

    <title>Direct Translation Applications</title>
<!--    <introduction> -->
      <p>
        In the previous examples,
        we learned how to translate application problems into systems of linear equations,
        but we didn't actually solve those problems.
        Now we'll translate a situation to a system of equations and then solve the system,
        using what we learned in <xref ref="section-substitution" />
        and <xref ref="section-elimination" />.
      </p>
<!--    </introduction> -->
    <example>
      <p>
        Translate to a system of equations and then solve: Devon is 26 years older than his son Cooper.
        The sum of their ages is 50.
        Find their ages.
      </p>
      <p>
        Here we'll use our 7-step strategy for solving application problems using a system of linear equations:
      </p>
      <p><dl>
        <li>
          <title>Step 1:</title>
            <p>Read the problem.
          </p>
          <p>
            Devon is 26 years older than his son Cooper.
            The sum of their ages is 50.
            Find their ages.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <title>Step 2:</title>
            <p>Identify what we are looking for.
          </p>
          <p>
            We are looking for the ages of Devon and Cooper.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <title>Step 3:</title>
            <p>Name what we are looking for.
          </p>
          <p>
            Let <m>d</m> represent Devon's age,
            in years, and <m>c</m> represent Cooper's age, in years.
          </p>

      Let's look at a couple more examples

    <example xml:id="example-solving-system-of-equations-student-demographics">
      <statement>
        <p>
          A college used to have a north campus with <m>6000</m> students and a south campus with <m>15{,}000</m> students.
          The percentage of students at the north campus who self-identify as LGBTQ was three times the percentage at the south campus.
          After the merge,
          <m>5.5\%</m> of students identify as LGBTQ. What percentage of students on each campus identified as LGBTQ before the merge?
        </p>
      </statement>
      <solution>
        <p>
          We will define <m>N</m> as the percentage
          (as a decimal)
          of students at the north campus and <m>S</m> as the percentage
          (as a decimal)
          of students at the south campus that identified as LGBTQ. Since the percentage of students at the north campus was three times the percentage at the south campus, we have:
          <me>
            N=3S
          </me>
          For our second equation,
          we will count LGBTQ students at the various campuses.
          At the north campus, multiply the population,
          <m>6000</m>, by the percentage <m>N</m> to get <m>6000N</m>.
          This must be the actual number of LGBTQ students.
          Similarly, the south campus has <m>15000S</m> LGBTQ students,
          and the combined school has <m>21000(0.055)=1155</m>.
          When we combine the two campuses, we have:
          <me>
            6000N+15000S=1155
          </me>
          We write the system as:
          <me>
            \left\{ \begin{aligned} N\amp=3S \\ 6000N+15000S\amp=1155 \end{aligned} \right.
          </me>
        </p>
        <p>
          Because the first equation is already solved for <m>N</m>,
          this is a good time to use the subsitution method.
          We can substitute <m>N</m> in our second equation with <m>3S</m> and solve for <m>S</m>:

          Let <m>A</m> be the number of avocados consumed and let <m>B</m> be the number of bagels consumed.
          Both <m>A</m> and <m>B</m> might be fractions.
          For our first equation,
          we will count calories from the avocados and bagels:
          <me>
            \left(300\,\tfrac{\text{calories}}{\text{avocado}}\right)(A\,\text{avocados})+\left(400\,\tfrac{\text{calories}}{\text{bagel}}\right)(B\,\text{bagel})=600\,\text{calories}
          </me>
          Or, without the units:
          <me>
            300A+400B=600
          </me>
          Similarly, for our second equation,
          we will count the grams of fat:
          <me>
            \left(30\,\tfrac{\text{g fat}}{\text{avocado}}\right)(A\,\text{avocados})+\left(8\,\tfrac{\text{g fat}}{\text{bagel}}\right)(B\,\text{bagel})=20\,\text{g fat}
          </me>
          Or, without the units:
          <me>
            30A+8B=20
          </me>
          So the system of equations is:
          <md>
            <mrow>\left\{ \begin{alignedat}{4} 300A \amp {}+{} \amp  400B \amp {}={} \amp 600 \\ 30A \amp {}+{} \amp  8B \amp {}={} \amp 20 \end{alignedat} \right.</mrow>
          </md>
        </p>
        <p>
          Since none of the coefficients are equal to <m>1</m>,
          it will be easier to use the elimination method to solve this system.
          Looking at the terms <m>300A</m> and <m>30A</m>,
          we can eliminate the <m>A</m> variable if we multiply the second equation by <m>-10</m> to get <m>-300A</m>:
          <md>
            <mrow>\amp\left\{ \begin{alignedat}{4} 300A \amp {}+{} \amp 400B \amp {}={} 600 \\ \multiplyleft{-10}(30A \amp {}+{} \amp 8B) \amp {}={} \multiplyleft{-10}(20) \end{alignedat} \right.</mrow>
            <mrow>\amp\left\{ \begin{alignedat}{4} 300A \amp {}+{} \amp 400B \amp {}={}\amp 600 \\ -300A \amp {}+{} \amp (-80B) \amp {}={}\amp {-200} \end{alignedat} \right.</mrow>
          </md>
          When we add the corresponding sides from the two equations together we have:
          <md>
            <mrow>\begin{aligned}300A+400B\\{}-300A-80B\end{aligned}\amp=\begin{aligned}600\\{}-200\end{aligned}</mrow>
            <intertext>So we have:</intertext>
            <mrow>320B\amp=400</mrow>
            <mrow>\divideunder{320B}{320}\amp=\divideunder{400}{320}</mrow>
            <mrow>B\amp=\frac{5}{4}</mrow>
          </md>
        </p>
        <p>
          We now know that Javed should eat <m>\frac{5}{4}</m> bagels
          (or one and one-quarter bagels).
          To determine the number of avocados,
          we will substitute <m>B</m> with
          <m>\frac{5}{4}</m> in either of our original equations.
          <md>
            <mrow>300A+400B\amp=600</mrow>
            <mrow>300A+400\left(\substitute{\frac{5}{4}}\right)\amp=600</mrow>

          </md>
        </p>
        <p>
          To check this result, try using <m>B=\frac{5}{4}</m> and
          <m>A=\frac{1}{3}</m> in each of the original equations:
          <md>
            <mrow>300A+400B\amp=600\amp 30A+8B\amp=20</mrow>
            <mrow>300\left(\substitute{\frac{1}{3}}\right)+400\left(\substitute{\frac{5}{4}}\right)\amp\stackrel{?}{=}600\amp30\left(\substitute{\frac{1}{3}}\right)+8\left(\substitute{\frac{5}{4}}\right)\amp\stackrel{?}{=}20</mrow>
            <mrow>100+500\amp\stackrel{\checkmark}{=}600\amp10+10\amp\stackrel{\checkmark}{=}20</mrow>
          </md>
        </p>
        <p>
          In summary, Javed can eat <m>\frac{5}{4}</m> of a bagel
          (so one and one-quarter bagel)
          and <m>\frac{1}{3}</m> of an avocado in order to consume exactly <m>600</m> calories and <m>20</m> grams of fat.

            The two angles are complementary angles,

              The measure of the larger angle is <var name="$answer1" width="5"/> degrees and the measure of the smaller angle is <var name="$answer2" width="5"/> degrees.
            </p>
          </statement>
          <solution>
            <p>
              We are looking for the measure of each of the two angles.
              So let <m>x</m> represent the measure of the larger angle and <m>y</m> represent the measure of the smaller angle.
            </p>
            <p>
              The two angles are supplementary angles,
              which means the sum of the measures of their angles is <m>180</m> degrees.
              This gives us one equation for our system:
              <me>
                x+y=180
              </me>
            </p>
            <p>
              The measure of the larger angle is <m>12</m> degrees more than three times the smaller angle.
              This translates into the following equation:
              <me>
                x=3y+12
              </me>
            </p>
            <p>
              Hence, our system is as follows:
              <me>
                \begin{cases} x + y = 180 \\ x = 3y + 12 \end{cases}
              </me>
            </p>
            <p>
              This system can be easily solved by substitution since the second equation already has <m>x</m> isolated.
              Thus, the first step in solving this system is to substitute the expression <m>3y+12</m> in place of <m>x</m> in the first equation.
              This will give us:
              <md>
                <mrow>(\substitute{3y+12})+y=180</mrow>
                <mrow>4y+12=180</mrow>
                <mrow>4y=168</mrow>
                <mrow>y=42</mrow>
              </md>
            </p>
            <p>
              Therefore, the smaller angle has a measure of <m>42</m> degrees.
            </p>
            <p>
              To find the measure of the larger angle,
              we can substitute <m>42</m> in place of <m>y</m> in the second equation:
              <md>
                <mrow>x=3(\substitute{42})+12</mrow>
                <mrow>x=126+12</mrow>
                <mrow>x=138</mrow>
              </md>
            </p>
            <p>
              Thus, the measure of the larger angle is <m>138</m> degrees.
              The check is left to the reader.

              </me>
              She has a total of <m>260</m> feet of fencing to use to fence the rectangular garden.
              Since the fencing will be used to outline the perimeter of the garden,</p>
              <p>we need to use the perimeter formula for a rectangle,
              <m>P=2L+2W</m>, and plug in <m>260</m> for <m>P</m>.
              This gives us our second equation:

              Find the dimensions of the pool.
            </p>
            <p>
              The length of the pool is <var name="$answer1" width="5"/> yards and the width is <var name="$answer2" width="5"/> yards.
            </p>
          </statement>
          <solution>
            <p>
              We are looking for the length and width of the rectangular pool.
              So let <m>L</m> represent the length and <m>W</m> represent the width.
            </p>
            <p>
              The perimeter of the rectangular pool is <m>68</m> yards.
              Using the perimeter formula, this gives us one equation for our system:
              <me>
                68=2L+2W
              </me>
            </p>
            <p>
              The length of the pool is two yards longer than three times its width.
              This translates into the following equation:
              <me>
                L=3W+2
              </me>
            </p>
            <p>
              Hence, our system is as follows:
              <me>
                \begin{cases} 68=2L+2W \\ L=3W+2 \end{cases}
              </me>
            </p>
            <p>
              This system can be easily solved by substitution since the second equation already has <m>L</m> isolated.
              Thus, the first step in solving this system is to substitute the expression <m>3W+2</m> in place of <m>L</m> in the first equation.
              Then, we solve for <m>W</m>.
              This will give us:
              <md>
                <mrow>68=2(\substitute{3W+2})+2W</mrow>
                <mrow>68=6W+4+2W</mrow>
                <mrow>68=8W+4</mrow>
                <mrow>64=8W</mrow>
                <mrow>W=8</mrow>
              </md>
            </p>
            <p>
              Therefore, the width of the pool is <m>8</m> yards.
            </p>
            <p>
              To find the length of the pool,
              we can substitute <m>8</m> in place of <m>W</m> in the second equation:
              <md>
                <mrow>L=3(\substitute{8})+2</mrow>
                <mrow>L=24+2</mrow>
                <mrow>L=26</mrow>
              </md>
            </p>
            <p>
              Thus, length of the pool is <m>26</m> yards.

    <title>Uniform Motion Applications</title>
    <idx><h>uniform motion applications</h></idx>
    <introduction>
      <p>
        The basic equation we use in uniform motion problems is <m>d=rt</m> where <m>d</m> is the distance traveled,
        <m>r</m> is the rate or speed at which the person or object is traveling,
        and <m>t</m> is the time the person or object has traveled.
        For these problems,
        we will learn how to use a table to organize our information,
        which will help us to translate the situation into a system of equations.
      </p>
    </introduction>
    <example xml:id="example-catch-up-driving">
      <p>
        Translate to a system of equations and then solve: Joni left St.
        Louis on the interstate,
        driving west toward Denver at a speed of 65 miles per hour.
        Half an hour later, Kelly left St.
        Louis on the same route as Joni,
        driving 78 miles per hour.
        How long will it take Kelly to catch up to Joni?
      </p>
      <p>
        A diagram is useful in helping us visualize the situation.</p>
        <sidebyside width="50%">

        <em>Identify and name</em> what we are looking for.
        A table will help us organize the information.
        We know the rates of both Joni and Kelly,
        and so we enter them in the table.
        We don't know how long they have been driving at those rates,
        so we will let <m>j</m> represent Joni's time, in hours,
        and let <m>k</m> represent Kelly's time,
        in hours, and enter that information into the table as well.
        Then, we can multiply the rates and times together to obtain an expression for each person's distance.
      </p>
      
        <sidebyside width="50%">

            <description>A table with column headings of type, rate, time, and distance. The types are Joni and Kelly. The rates are 65 and 78. The times are variables j and k. The distances are 65j and 78j.</description>
          </image>
        </sidebyside>
      
      <p>
        <em>Translate</em> into a system of equations.
        To make the system of equations,
        we must recognize that Kelly and Joni will drive the same distance.
        So, <m>65j=78k</m>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Also, since Kelly left later,
        her time will be <m>\frac{1}{2}</m> hour less than Joni's time.
        So, <m>k=j-\frac{1}{2}</m>.
        Now we have a system:
        <md>
          <mrow>\left\{ \begin{alignedat}{4} 65j\amp {}={} \amp 78k \\ k\amp {}={} j \amp {}-{} \amp \frac{1}{2} \end{alignedat} \right.</mrow>
        </md>
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Solve</em> the system of equations,
        either by substitution or elimination.
        This system,
        lends itself easily to substitution since <m>k</m> is already isolated in the second equation.
        Thus, we can substitute the expression
        <m>j-\frac{1}{2}</m> in place of <m>k</m> in the first equation:
        <md>
          <mrow>65j=78\left(\substitute{j-\frac{1}{2}}\right)</mrow>
          <mrow>65j=78j-39</mrow>
          <mrow>-13j=-39</mrow>
          <mrow>j=3</mrow>
        </md>
      </p>
      <p>
        Substitute <m>3</m> for <m>j</m> in the second equation and solve for <m>k</m>:
        <md>
          <mrow>k=\substitute{3}-\frac{1}{2}</mrow>
          <mrow>k=2.5</mrow>
        </md>
      </p>
      <p>
        Therefore, it will take Kelly <m>2.5</m> hours to catch up to Joni.

            <p>
              <em>Identify and name</em> what you are looking for.
              Make a table,
              similar to the one we used in <xref ref="example-catch-up-driving" />
              to help you organize the information.
              We are given the rates of both Charlie and Sally,
              and so you can enter them into your table.
              We don't know how long they have been driving at those rates,
              so you can let <m>c</m> represent Charlie's time, in hours,
              and let <m>s</m> represent Sally's time,
              in hours, and enter that information into the table as well.
              Then, you can multiply the rates and times together to obtain an expression for each person's distance.
              You should end up with <m>36c</m> for Charlie's distance and <m>48s</m> for Sally's distance.
            </p>
            <p>
              Next you need to translate into a system of equations.
              To make the system of equations,
              you should recognize that Charlie and Sally will have driven the same distance once Sally has caught up to Charlie.
              So, <m>36c=48s</m>.
            </p>
            <p>
              Also, since Sally left <m>\frac{1}{4}</m> hour later,
              her time will be <m>\frac{1}{4}</m> hour less than Charlie's time.
              So, <m>s=c-\frac{1}{4}</m>.
              Now we have a system:
              <me>
                \begin{cases} 36c = 48s \\ s = c - \frac{1}{4} \end{cases}
              </me>
            </p>
            <p>
              Now solve the system of equations,
              either by substitution or elimination.
              This system,
              lends itself easily to substitution since <m>s</m> is already isolated in the second equation.
              Thus, we can substitute the expression
              <m>c-\frac{1}{4}</m> in place of <m>s</m> in the first equation:
              <md>
                <mrow>36c=48\left(\substitute{c-\frac{1}{4}}\right)</mrow>
                <mrow>36c=48c-12</mrow>
                <mrow>-12c=-12</mrow>
                <mrow>c=1</mrow>
              </md>
            </p>
            <p>
              Note that all we were asked to find is how long Charlie will have been driving before Sally catches up,
              so we don't need to go any further.
              We now know that Charlie had been driving for <m>1</m> hour before Sally caught up with him.

      Many real-world applications of uniform motion arise because of the effects of currents - of water or air - on the actual speed of a vehicle.
      For example,
      cross-country airplane flights in the United States generally take longer going west than going east because of the prevailing wind currents.
    </p>
    <p>
      Let's take a look at a boat traveling on a river.
      Depending on which way the boat is going,
      the curent of the water is either slowing it down or speeding it up.
    </p>
    <p>
      <xref ref="figure-downstream" />
      and <xref ref="figure-upstream" />
      show how a river current affects the speed at which a boat is actually traveling.
      We'll call the speed of the boat in still water <m>b</m> and the speed of the river current <m>c</m>.
    </p>
    <p>
      In <xref ref="figure-downstream" /> the boat is going downstream,
      in the same direction as the river current.
      The current helps push the boat,
      so the boat's actual speed is faster than its speed in still water.
      The actual speed at which the boat is moving is <m>b+c</m>.
    </p>

        </image>
      </sidebyside>
    
    <p>
      In <xref ref="figure-upstream" /> the boat is going upstream,
      opposite the river current.
      The current is going against the boat,
      so the boat's actual speed is slower than its speed in still water.
      The actual speed of the boat is <m>b-c</m>.

        <em>Identify and name</em> what we are looking for.
        A table will help us organize the information,
        including the use of the formula <m>d=rt</m>.
        We know the times of both trips downstream and upstream,
        and so we enter those times in the table.
        We also know that the distance for both trips is <m>60</m> miles,
        so we can also enter that information into the table.
        We don't know the ship's speed in still water or the speed of the current,
        so we will let <m>s</m> represent the ship's speed, in miles per hour,
        in still water and let <m>c</m> represent the speed of the current,
        in miles per hour.
      </p>
      <p>
        As explained previously,
        when the ship is going downstream,
        the current will push the ship faster,
        so the rate at which the ship is traveling can be represented by <m>s+c</m>.
        When the ship is going upstream,
        the current will slow the ship down,
        so the rate at which the ship will be traveling can be represented by <m>s-c</m>.
        We can now enter that information into the table as well.

        <em>Translate</em> into a system of equations.
        To make the system of equations,
        we use the fact that the product of the rate and the time is equal to the distance for each trip.
        This will give us our two equations:
        <me>
          \begin{cases} 4(s+c)=60\\5(s-c)=60 \end{cases}
        </me>
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Solve</em> the system of equations,
        either by substitution or elimination.
        The first thing to do is simplify each equation by using the distributive property to get rid of the parentheses:
        <me>
          \begin{cases} 4s+4c=60\\5s-5c=60 \end{cases}
        </me>
      </p>
      <p>
        Since all the variable terms have a coefficient
        (not equal to one),
        the best method to use to solve this system is the elimination method.
      </p>
      <p>
        Notice that the <m>c</m> terms already have opposite signs,
        so we'll work to eliminate the variable <m>c</m>.
        The least common mutiple of <m>4</m> and <m>5</m> is <m>20</m>,
        so if we multiply both sides of the first equation by <m>5</m> and both sides of the second equation by <m>4</m>,
        then the new <m>c</m> terms will be <m>20c</m> and <m>-20c</m> respectively,
        which eliminate the <m>c</m> terms when the new equations are added together.
      </p>
      <p>
        Multiply both sides of the first equation by <m>5</m> and both sides of the second equation by <m>4</m>:
        <md>
          <mrow>5(4s+4c)=5(60)</mrow>
          <mrow>4(5s-5c)=4(60)</mrow>
        </md>
      </p>
      <p>
        Now, our new system is:
        <me>
          \begin{cases} 20s+20c=300\\20s-20c=240 \end{cases}
        </me>
      </p>
      <p>
        Add the first equation to the second equation.
        Then, solve for <m>s</m>.
      </p>
      <p>
        <md>
          <mrow>\begin{aligned}20s+20c\\{}+20s-20c\end{aligned}\amp=\begin{aligned}300\\{}+240\end{aligned}</mrow>
        </md>
        So we have
        <md>
          <mrow>40s=540</mrow>
          <mrow>s=13.5</mrow>
        </md>
      </p>
      <p>
        Substitute <m>13.5</m> for <m>s</m> in the first original equation and solve for <m>c</m>:
        <md>
          <mrow>4(\substitute{13.5}+c)=60</mrow>
          <mrow>54+4c=60</mrow>
          <mrow>4c=6</mrow>
          <mrow>c=1.5</mrow>
        </md>
      </p>
      <p>
        Therefore, the ship's speed in still water is <m>13.5</m> miles per hour and the speed of the current is <m>1.5</m> miles per hour.

          A table will help us organize the information,
          including the use of the formula <m>d=rt</m>.
          The time of both trips is given to be three hours and so we enter that time in the table,
          in the appropriate spots.
          We also know the distances for each trip,
          which is <m>1095</m> miles with a tailwind and <m>987</m> miles into a headwind,
          so we can also enter that information into the table.
          We don't know the jet's speed in still air or the speed of the wind,

        <p>
          Note that when the jet is flying with the tailwind,
          that means the wind will be pushing the jet faster than it would be going in still air,
          so we can represent its rate with the tailwind as <m>j+w</m>.
          In contrast, when the jet is flying into the tailwind,
          the wind will slow the jet down,
          making it go slower than it would be traveling in still air,
          so we can represent its rate into the tailwind as <m>j-w</m>.
          These expressions can then be entered into the table for each rate.

          His budget requires that the trail mix costs him <m>\$7.60</m> per pound.
          Nuts cost <m>\$9.00</m> per pound and chocolate chips cost <m>\$2.00</m> per pound.

          We will create a table to organize the information.
          Note that with mixture problems,
          when mixing two ingredients,
          we will have one row for each ingredient and one total row for the final mixture,
          giving us three rows in our table.

          <em>Identify</em> what we are looking for.
          We are looking for the number of pounds of nuts and the number of pounds of chocolate chips.

          Carson will mix nuts and chocolate chips to get trail mix.

          There will be <m>20</m> pounds of trail mix.

        <p>
          Put the price per pound of each item in the Value column.

          Note that an advantage of setting up the table this way,
          in mixture problems,
          is that the first and last columns will always give us the two equations we need for our system,
          where the cells in the first two rows must always add to the last cell in the total row.
          So we get the two equations for our system from the Number of Pounds column and the Total Value column:

            \begin{cases}n+c=20\\9n+2c=152 \end{cases}

        <p>
          Multiply the first equation by <m>-2</m> to eliminate <m>c</m>.

        Sasheena is a lab assistant at her community college.
        She needs to make <m>200</m> milliliters of a <m>40\%</m> solution of sulfuric acid for a lab experiment.
        The lab has only <m>25\%</m> and <m>50\%</m> solutions in the storeroom.
        How much should she mix of the <m>25\%</m> and the <m>50\%</m> solutions to make the <m>40\%</m> solution?
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Read</em> the problem.
        A figure may help us visualize the situation,
        then we will create a table to organize the information.
      </p>
      <p>
        Sasheena must mix some of the <m>25\%</m> solution and some of the <m>50\%</m> solution together to create <m>200</m><quantity>
          <unit prefix="milli" base="liter"/>
        </quantity>
        of the <m>40\%</m> solution.

        <em>Name</em> what we are looking for.
      </p>
      <p>
        The two unknowns are the amount of each type of solution being mixed together.
        Let <m>x</m> represent the amount of <m>25\%</m> solution (in
        <quantity>
          <unit prefix="milli" base="liter"/>
        </quantity>) and let <m>y</m> represent the amount of <m>50\%</m> solution
        (in
        <quantity>
          <unit prefix="milli" base="liter"/>
        </quantity>).
        One quantity given to us in the problem is
        <quantity>
          <mag>200</mag><unit prefix="milli" base="liter"/>
        </quantity>, which is the amount of the <m>40\%</m> solution that needs to be created.
      </p>
      <p>
        These three amounts,
        as well as the concentrations for each type of solution,
        can be entered into the table and then the amount of sulfuric acid in each type of solution can be calculated by multiplying the number of milliters of solution times the concentration
        (in decimal form).

        <em>Translate</em> into a system of equations.
        Since <m>200</m><quantity>
          <unit prefix="milli" base="liter"/>
        </quantity>
        is the total volume of the <m>40\%</m> solution,
        we must have for one of the equations in the system:
        <me>
          (x\,\text{mL})+(y\,\text{mL})=200\,\text{mL}
        </me>
        Or without units:
        <me>
          x+y=200
        </me>
      </p>
      <p>
        To build the second equation,
        we have to think about the  <em>amount</em> (in
        <quantity>
          <unit prefix="milli" base="liter"/>
        </quantity>) of <em>sulfuric acid</em> being mixed.
        If we have <m>x</m> milliliters of solution that is <m>25\%</m> sulfuric acid,
        then <m>0.25x</m> is the actual <em>amount</em> (in
        <quantity>
          <unit prefix="milli" base="liter"/>
        </quantity>) of sulfuric acid in that solution.
        Similarly, <m>0.50y</m> is the amount of sulfuric acid in the <m>50\%</m> solution.
        The final solution is
        <quantity>
          <mag>200</mag><unit prefix="milli" base="liter"/>
        </quantity>
        of solution that is <m>40\%</m> sulfuric acid,
        so it has <m>0.40(200)=80</m><quantity>
          <unit prefix="milli" base="liter"/>
        </quantity>
        of sulfuric acid.
        All of this together means:
        <me>
          0.25(x\,\text{mL})+0.50(y\,\text{mL})=80\,\text{mL}
        </me>
        Or without units:
        <me>
          0.25x+0.50y=80
        </me>
      </p>
      <p>
        So our system is:
        <me>
          \left\{ \begin{alignedat}{3} x\amp+{}\amp y\amp=200 \\ 0.25x\amp+{}\amp0.50y\amp=80 \end{alignedat} \right.
        </me>
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Solve</em> the system of equations.
        To solve this system, we'll solve for <m>x</m> in the first equation:
        <md>
          <mrow>x+y\amp=200</mrow>
          <mrow>x\amp=200-y</mrow>
        </md>
        And then substitute <m>x</m> in the second equation with <m>200-y</m>:
        <md>
          <mrow>0.25x+0.50y\amp=80</mrow>

        </md>
        As a last step,

              Drawing a figure similar to the one in <xref ref="example-solving-systems-of-equations-chemistry-solution-application" />
              may help you visualize the situation.
              Then creating a table, similar to the table in that same example,
              can help you to organize the information.
            </p>
            <p>
              Anatole must mix some of the <m>10\%</m> solution and some of the <m>35\%</m> solution together to create <m>250</m><quantity>

              </quantity>
              of the <m>25\%</m> solution.
            </p>
            <p>
              <em>Name</em> what we are looking for.
            </p>
            <p>
              The two unknowns are the amount of each type of solution being mixed together.
              Let <m>x</m> represent the amount of <m>10\%</m> solution (in
              <quantity>
                <unit prefix="milli" base="liter"/>
              </quantity>) and let <m>y</m> represent the amount of <m>35\%</m> solution
              (in
              <quantity>
                <unit prefix="milli" base="liter"/>
              </quantity>).
              One quantity given to us in the problem is
              <quantity>
                <mag>250</mag><unit prefix="milli" base="liter"/>
              </quantity>, which is the amount of the <m>25\%</m> solution that needs to be created.
            </p>
            <p>
              These three amounts,
              as well as the concentrations for each type of solution,
              can be entered into the table and then the amount of hydrochloric acid in each type of solution can be calculated by multiplying the number of milliters of solution times the concentration
              (in decimal form).
            </p>
            <p>
              <em>Translate</em> into a system of equations.
              Since <m>250</m><quantity>
                <unit prefix="milli" base="liter"/>
              </quantity>
              is the total volume of the <m>25\%</m> solution,
              we must have for one of the equations in the system:
              <me>
                (x\,\text{mL})+(y\,\text{mL})=250\,\text{mL}
              </me>
              Or without units:
              <me>
                x+y=250
              </me>
            </p>
            <p>
              To build the second equation,
              we have to think about the  <em>amount</em> (in
              <quantity>
                <unit prefix="milli" base="liter"/>
              </quantity>) of <em>hydrochloric acid</em> being mixed.
              If we have <m>x</m> milliliters of solution that is <m>10\%</m> hydrochloric acid,
              then <m>0.10x</m> is the actual <em>amount</em> (in
              <quantity>
                <unit prefix="milli" base="liter"/>
              </quantity>) of hydrochloric acid in that solution.
              Similarly, <m>0.35y</m> is the amount of hydrochloric acid in the <m>35\%</m> solution.
              The final solution is
              <quantity>
                <mag>250</mag><unit prefix="milli" base="liter"/>
              </quantity>
              of solution that is <m>25\%</m> hydrochloric acid,
              so it has <m>0.25(250)=62.5</m><quantity>
                <unit prefix="milli" base="liter"/>
              </quantity>
              of hydrochloric acid.
              All of this together means:
              <me>
                0.10(x\,\text{mL})+0.35(y\,\text{mL})=62.5\,\text{mL}
              </me>
              Or without units:
              <me>
                0.10x+0.35y=62.5
              </me>
            </p>
            <p>
              So our system is:
              <me>
                \left\{ \begin{alignedat}{3} x\amp+{}\amp y\amp=250 \\ 0.10x\amp+{}\amp0.35y\amp=62.5 \end{alignedat} \right.
              </me>
            </p>
            <p>
              <em>Solve</em> the system of equations.
              To solve this system, we'll solve for <m>x</m> in the first equation:
              <md>
                <mrow>x+y\amp=250</mrow>
                <mrow>x\amp=250-y</mrow>
              </md>
              And then substitute <m>x</m> in the second equation with <m>250-y</m>:
              <md>
                <mrow>0.10x+0.35y\amp=62.5</mrow>
                <mrow>0.10(\substitute{250-y})+0.35y\amp=62.5</mrow>
                <mrow>25-0.10y+0.35y\amp=62.5</mrow>
                <mrow>25+0.25y\amp=62.5</mrow>
                <mrow>0.25y\amp=37.5</mrow>

                <mrow>y\amp=150</mrow>
              </md>
              As a last step,
              we will determine <m>x</m> using the equation where we had isolated <m>x</m>:
              <md>
                <mrow>x\amp=250-y</mrow>

    <title>Interest Applications</title>
    <introduction>
      <p>
        The formula to model interest applications is <m>I=Prt</m>.
        Interest earned or owed, <m>I</m>,
        is the product of the principal, <m>P</m>,
        the rate, <m>r</m>, and the time
        (in years),
        <m>t</m>.
      </p>
      <p>
        In these interest application problems,
        we'll use a table to organize the information,
        similar to uniform motion and mixture applications,
        as you'll see in <xref ref="example-solving-system-of-equations-interest-application" />.

      <title>Owing at Two Different Rates</title>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Notah made some large purchases with his two credit cards one month and took on a total of
          <m>\$8{,}400</m> in debt from the two cards.
          He didn't make any payments the first month,
          so the two credit card debts each started to accrue interest.
          That month, his Visa card charged <m>2\%</m> interest and his Mastercard charged <m>2.5\%</m> interest.
          Because of this, Notah's total debt grew by <m>\$178</m>.
          How much money did Notah charge to each card?
        </p>
      </statement>
      <solution>
        <p>
          To start, we will define two variables based on our two unknowns.
          Let <m>v</m> be the amount charged to the Visa card
          (in dollars)
          and let <m>m</m> be the amount charged to the Mastercard
          (in dollars).
        </p>
        <p>
          To determine our equations, notice that we are given two different totals.
          We will use these to form our two equations.
          The total amount charged is <m>\$8{,}400</m> so we have:
          <me>
            (v\,\text{dollars})+(m\,\text{dollars})=\$8400
          </me>
          Or without units:
          <me>
            v+m=8400
          </me>
          The other total we were given is the total amount of interest,
          <m>\$178</m>, which is also in dollars.
          The Visa had <m>v</m> dollars charged to it and accrues <m>2\%</m> interest.
          So <m>0.02v</m> is the dollar amount of interest that comes from using this card.
          Similarly, <m>0.025m</m> is the dollar amount of interest from using the Mastercard.
          Together:
          <me>
            0.02(v\,\text{dollars})+0.025(m\,\text{dollars})=\$178
          </me>
          Or without units:
          <me>
            0.02v+0.025m=178
          </me>
          As a system, we write:
          <me>
            \left\{ \begin{alignedat}{3} v\amp+{}\amp m\amp={}8400 \\ 0.02v\amp+{}\amp 0.025m\amp{}=178 \\ \end{alignedat} \right.
          </me>
        </p>
        <p>
          To solve this system by substitution,
          notice that it will be easier to solve for one of the variables in the first equation.
          We'll solve that equation for <m>v</m>:
          <md>
            <mrow>v+m\amp=8400</mrow>
 <!-- <mrow>v+m\subtractright{m}\amp=8400\subtractright{m}</mrow> -->
            <mrow>v\amp=8400-m</mrow>
          </md>
          Now we will substitute <m>8400-m</m> for <m>v</m> in the second equation:
          <md>
            <mrow>0.02v+0.025m\amp=178</mrow>
            <mrow>0.02(\substitute{8400-m})+0.025m\amp=178</mrow>
            <mrow>168-0.02m+0.025m\amp=178</mrow>
            <mrow>168+0.005m\amp=178</mrow>
            <mrow>0.005m\amp=10</mrow>
            <mrow>m\amp=2000</mrow>
          </md>
          Lastly, we can determine the value of <m>v</m> by using the earlier equation where we isolated <m>v</m>:
          <md>
            <mrow>v\amp=8400-m</mrow>
            <mrow>v\amp=8400-\substitute{2000}</mrow>
            <mrow>v\amp=6400</mrow>
          </md>
        </p>
        <p>
          In summary, Notah charged <m>\$6400</m> to the Visa and <m>\$2000</m> to the Mastercard.
          We should check that these numbers work as solutions to our original system <em>and</em>
          that they make sense in context.
          (For instance, if one of these numbers were negative,
          or was something small like <m>\$0.50</m>,
          they wouldn't make sense as credit card debt.)

        <statement><p><var name="$name"/> invested a total of <m><var name="$cInit"/></m> in two accounts. After a year, one account lost <var name="$p1"/>%, while the other account gained <var name="$p2"/>%. In total, <var name="$name"/> lost <m><var name="$cTotalInt"/></m>. How much money did <var name="$pronoun"/> invest in each account?</p>

        <p>Write and solve a system of equations to answer the following questions.</p>

        <p><var name="$name"/> invested <var name="$cFund1" width="20"/> in the account with <var name="$p1"/>% loss.</p>

        <p><var name="$name"/> invested <var name="$cFund2" width="20"/> in the account with <var name="$p2"/>% gain.</p>
        </statement>

        <solution><p>Assume <var name="$name"/> invested <m>x</m> dollars in the account with <var name="$p1"/>% loss, and <m>y</m> dollars in the account with <var name="$p2"/>% gain.</p>

        <p>It's given that the total amount of investment was <m><var name="$cInit"/></m>, so we have:

            <me>x+y=<var name="$rInit"/></me>

        Since the first account lost <var name="$p1"/>% for <m>x</m> dollars, the amount of loss was <m><var name="$dp1"/>x</m> dollars.</p>

        <p>Similarly, since the second account gained <var name="$p2"/>% for <m>y</m> dollars, the amount of gain was <m><var name="$dp2"/>y</m> dollars.</p>

        <p>It's given that the total amount of loss was <m><var name="$cTotalInt"/></m>, so we have:

            <me>-<var name="$dp1"/>x+<var name="$dp2"/>y= -<var name="$rTotalInt"/></me></p>

        <p>Now we have a system of equations:

            <me>\begin{cases}x+y=<var name="$rInit"/> \\ -<var name="$dp1"/>x+<var name="$dp2"/>y= -<var name="$rTotalInt"/> \end{cases}</me></p>

        <p>We will use substitution to solve this problem. First, we solve for <m>y</m> in the first equation:<md>

            <mrow>x+y\amp=<var name="$rInit"/></mrow>
            <mrow>x+y\subtractright{x}\amp=<var name="$rInit"/>\subtractright{x}</mrow>
            <mrow>y=<var name="$rInit"/>-x</mrow></md></p>


        <p>Next, we substitute <m>y</m> with <m><var name="$rInit"/>-x</m> in <m>-<var name="$dp1"/>x+<var name="$dp2"/>y= -<var name="$rTotalInt"/></m>, and we have:<md>

            <mrow>-<var name="$dp1"/>x+<var name="$dp2"/>y\amp= -<var name="$rTotalInt"/></mrow>
            <mrow>-<var name="$dp1"/>x+<var name="$dp2"/>(\substitute{<var name="$rInit"/>-x})\amp= -<var name="$rTotalInt"/></mrow>
            <mrow>-<var name="$dp1"/>x+<var name="$dp2"/>(<var name="$rInit"/>)-<var name="$dp2"/>x\amp=-<var name="$rTotalInt"/></mrow>
            <mrow><var name="$s3"/>-<var name="$s2"/>x\amp=<var name="$rTotalInt"/></mrow>
            <mrow><var name="$s3"/>-<var name="$s2"/>x\subtractright{<var name="$s3"/>}\amp=-<var name="$rTotalInt"/>\subtractright{<var name="$s3"/>}</mrow>
            <mrow>-<var name="$s2"/>x\amp=<var name="$s1"/></mrow>
            <mrow>x\amp=<var name="$rFund1"/></mrow></md></p>

        <p>Finally, we substitute <m>x=<var name="$rFund1"/></m> into <m>y=<var name="$rInit"/>-x</m>, and we have:<md>

            <mrow>y\amp=<var name="$rInit"/>-x</mrow>
            <mrow>y\amp=<var name="$rInit"/>-\substitute{<var name="$rFund1"/>}</mrow>
            <mrow>y\amp=<var name="$rFund2"/></mrow></md></p>

        <p>The solution to the system of equations is <m>x=<var name="$rFund1"/></m>, <m>y=<var name="$rFund2"/></m>. This implies that <var name="$name"/> invested <m><var name="$cFund1"/></m> in the account with <var name="$p1"/>% loss and <m><var name="$cFund2"/></m> in the account with <var name="$p2"/>% gain.</p>
