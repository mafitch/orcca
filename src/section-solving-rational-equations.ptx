      Recall from <xref ref="linear-equations-and-inequalities-with-fractions" />
      that we learned the best way to solve equations with fractions is to first clear the fractions by multiplying every term on both sides of the equation by the LCD of all the fractions.
      Since a rational equation is also an equation with fractions,
      although with more complicated fractions than those we saw in that earlier section,
      with variables in the denominators,
      we can solve rational equations the same way:
      by first clearing the fractions.
      You may wish to review the technique of clearing the fractions by eliminating the denominators discussed in <xref ref="subsection-eliminating-denominators" />.
      We will use this same technique to clear the fractions from rational equations.
    </p>
    <example permid="ojQ">
      <title>Solving a Rational Equation by First Clearing the Fractions</title>
      <p permid="lZe">
        Use the technique of clearing the fractions to solve the rational equation <m>\frac{2}{x}+\frac{1}{4}=\frac{5}{2x}</m>.
      </p>
      <p permid="Sgn">
        To clear the fractions from an equation,
        we must first find the LCD of all the fractions in the equation.
        Recall that to find the LCD, we should first factor each denominator completely and then take factors from each denominator,
        one by one,
        only taking factors that we haven't already taken from a previous denominator,
        and then multiply them all together.
      </p>
      <p permid="ynw">
        Here is the equation again with the denominators factored completely:
        <me permid="oyl">
          \frac{2}{x}+\frac{1}{2\cdot2}=\frac{5}{2\cdot x}
        </me>
        Now, to build the LCD, we need to take the factor of <m>x</m> from the first denominator and both factors of <m>2</m> from the second denominator.
        However, when we look at the third denominator,
        we notice that we already have both of those factors,
        so we don't need to take any factors from the third denominator.
        Thus, the LCD is <m>x\cdot2\cdot2=4x</m>.
      </p>
      <p permid="euF">
        Now, what we do with the LCD is multiply both sides of the equation by the LCD and this will clear the fractions.
        To show how this works,
        we'll keep the <m>4x</m> and the denominators in factored form.
        Then, you can see how all of the factors in all of the denominators will end up canceling out.
        <md permid="RKO">

      </p>
      <p permid="KBO">
        As you can see, once the fractions are cleared,
        we end up with a much simpler equation to solve.
        This is why it is recommended that you clear the fractions first,
        whenever solving a rational equation.
      </p>
    </example>
    <remark permid="MMA">
      <p permid="xid">
        Because of the step where factors were canceled,
        it's possible that the solutions obtained through the solving process may not actually be solutions to the original equation.
        They each might be what is called an
        <term>extraneous solution</term>.
            <idx><h>extraneous solution</h></idx>
        An extraneous solution is a number that would appear to be a solution based on the solving process,
        but actually does not make the original equation true.
        This would be the case, for example,
        if a proposed solution would cause division by zero in the original equation.
        Because of this, it is important that these proposed solutions
        <em>always</em> be checked.
        Note that we're not checking to see if we made a calculation error,
        but are instead checking to see if the proposed solutions actually solve the original equation or may instead be extraneous.

    <title>Application Problems</title>
    <p permid="fez">
      To start this section,
      we will revisit a scenario we have seen before in <xref ref="example-boat-river-rational-function" />:
    </p>
    <example permid="sTJ">
      <title>A Uniform Motion Example</title>
      <p permid="jey">
        Julia is taking her family on a boat trip <m>12</m> miles down the river and back.
        The river flows at a speed of <m>2</m> miles per hour and she wants to drive the boat at a constant speed,
        <m>b</m> miles per hour downstream and back upstream.
        Due to the current of the river,
        the actual speed of travel is <m>b+2</m> miles per hour going downstream,
        and <m>b-2</m> miles per hour going upstream.
        If Julia plans to spend <m>8</m> hours for the whole trip,
        how fast should she drive the boat?
      </p>
      <p permid="PlH">
        As explained in <xref ref="example-boat-river-rational-function" />,
        the time it takes Julia to drive the boat downstream can be represented by <m>\frac{12}{b+2}</m> hours,
        and upstream can be represented by <m>\frac{12}{b-2}</m> hours.
        The function to model the whole trip's time is
        <me permid="AMD">
          t(b)=\frac{12}{b-2}+\frac{12}{b+2}
        </me>
        where the function name, <m>t</m>, stands for time in hours.
        The trip will take a total of <m>8</m> hours,
        so we substitute <m>t(b)</m> with <m>8</m>, and we have:
        <me permid="gTM">
          8=\frac{12}{b-2}+\frac{12}{b+2}
        </me>.
        We will solve this equation algebraically,
        by first clearing the fractions.
        To remove the fractions in this equation,
        we will multiply both sides of the equation by the least common denominator <m>(b-2)(b+2)</m>,
        and we have:

        Algebraically, both values do check out to be solutions.

      Another type of application problem we will look at is what is known as a
      <term>shared-work problem</term>.
          <idx><h>shared-work problem</h></idx>
      This is a situation where two
      (or more)
      people
      (or machines or pipes, etc.)
      are completing a task.
      There are times at which each person can complete the task alone and then there is a time at which they can complete the task if they work together.
      Any or all of these times may be unknown.
      What <em>is</em> known is the relationship between those times.
      Here is a formula that describes this relationship,
      which you may use to set up these shared-work problems:
      <me permid="NaV">
        \frac{1}{a}+\frac{1}{b}=\frac{1}{c}
      </me>
      Here, <m>a</m> represents how long it takes one person
      (or machine or pipe, etc.)
      to complete a task alone,
      <m>b</m> represents how long it takes a second person
      (or machine or pipe, etc.)
      to complete the same task alone,
      and <m>c</m> represents how long it takes for both people
      (or machines or pipes, etc.)
      to complete the same task if they work together.
    </p>
    <p permid="jOs">
      You can think of it this way: If it takes <m>a</m> hours for a person to complete a task,
      then after an hour,
      this person will have completed <m>\frac{1}{a}</m> of the task.
      Likewise, if it takes <m>b</m> hours for a second person to complete the same task,
      then after an hour,
      this second person will have completed <m>\frac{1}{b}</m> of the task,
      and so when the two work together,
      after one hour they will have completed <m>\frac{1}{a}+\frac{1}{b}</m> of the task.
      But if it takes them <m>c</m> hours to complete the task together,
      then after an hour,
      they will have completed <m>\frac{1}{c}</m> of the task.
      Thus, setting these two last expressions equal gives us our formula <m>\frac{1}{a}+\frac{1}{b}=\frac{1}{c}</m>.
    </p>
    <p permid="PVB">
      Variables, expressions, or known values may be substituted for <m>a</m>,
      <m>b</m>, and <m>c</m>, depending on the given situation,
      and this will give you a rational equation which can be solved to answer the question.

        Since it takes Ku <m>3</m> hours to paint the room, we can let <m>a=3</m>.
