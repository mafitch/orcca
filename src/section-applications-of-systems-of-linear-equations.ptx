  <title>Applications of Systems of Linear Equations</title>
  <introduction permid="hTJ">

      below is an example of how a system of linear equations can be used to solve an application problem.
      In this section,
      we will look at several types of application problems that can be solved using a system of linear equations,
      while giving you some strategies for solving these problems.
    </p>
  </introduction>
  <example xml:id="example-system-of-equations-elimination-intro" permid="VFr">
    <p permid="VcO">
      Alicia has <m>\$1000</m> to give to her two grandchildren for New Year's.
      She would like to give the older grandchild <m>\$120</m> more than the younger grandchild,
      because that is the cost of the older grandchild's college textbooks this term.
      How much money should she give to each grandchild?
    </p>
    <p permid="BjX">
      As always, we start solving a word problem by defining the variables,
      including their units.
      Let <m>A</m> be the dollar amount she gives to her older grandchild,
      and <m>B</m> be the dollar amount she gives to her younger grandchild.
      Since the total she has to give is <m>\$1000</m>,
      we can say that <m>A+B=1000</m>.
      Since she wants to give <m>\$120</m> more to the older grandchild,
      we can say that the difference between the amounts is <m>\$120</m>,
      or translated as a linear equation, <m>A-B=120</m>.
      This gives us two linear equations,
      which together makes a system of linear equations:
      <md permid="vCc">
        <mrow>\left\{ \begin{aligned} A+B \amp = 1000 \\ A-B \amp = 120 \end{aligned} \right.</mrow>
      </md>
    </p>
    <p permid="hrg">
      We can solve this system by either substitution as we learned in <xref ref="section-substitution">Section</xref>
      or by elimination as we learned in <xref ref="section-elimination">Section</xref>.
      Notice that if we add together the <em>left</em>
      sides from the two equations,
      the variable <m>B</m> will be eliminated quite easily:
      <md permid="bJl">
        <mrow>\begin{aligned}A+B\\{}+A-B\end{aligned}\amp=\begin{aligned}1000\\{}+120\end{aligned}</mrow>
        <intertext>So we have:</intertext>
        <mrow>2A\amp=1120</mrow>
      </md>
    </p>
    <p permid="Nyp">
      Thus, the elimination method is an easy method to use and it doesn't take much to finish solving for <m>A</m>:
      <md permid="HQu">
        <mrow>2A\amp=1120</mrow>
 <!-- <mrow>\divideunder{2A}{2}\amp=\divideunder{1120}{2}</mrow> -->
        <mrow>A\amp=560</mrow>
      </md>
    </p>
    <p permid="tFy">
      To finish solving this system of equations,
      we need the value of <m>B</m>.
      For now, an easy way to find <m>B</m> is to substitute in our value of <m>A</m> into one of the original equations:
      <md permid="nXD">
        <mrow>A+B\amp=1000</mrow>
        <mrow>\substitute{560}+B\amp=1000</mrow>
 <!-- <mrow>560+B\subtractright{560}\amp=1000\subtractright{560}</mrow> -->
        <mrow>B\amp=440</mrow>
      </md>
      To check our work,
      substitute <m>A=560</m> and <m>B=440</m> into the original equations:
      <md permid="UeM">
        <mrow>A+B\amp=1000\amp A-B\amp=120</mrow>
        <mrow>\substitute{560}+\substitute{440}\amp\stackrel{?}{=}1000\amp \substitute{560}-\substitute{440}\amp\stackrel{?}{=}120</mrow>
        <mrow>1000\amp\stackrel{\checkmark}{=}1000\amp 120\amp\stackrel{\checkmark}{=}120</mrow>
      </md>
    </p>
    <p permid="ZMH">
      This confirms that our solution is correct.
      In summary, Alicia should give <m>\$560</m> to her older grandchild and <m>\$440</m> to her younger grandchild.
    </p>

    <title>Translating to a System of Equations</title>
    <p permid="buQ">
      Many times the challenge of solving application problems is being able to translate the situations into algebraic equations.
      When trying to solve application problems using systems of equations,
      students often make the mistake of trying to combine the two separate relationships that are present in the situation.
      The key is to determine what the
      <em>two separate</em> relationships are and then to keep in mind that these <em>two</em>
      relationships will be the basis of the <em>two</em>
      equations that will make up your system.
    </p>
    <p permid="HBZ">
      Let's look at a couple of examples,
      where we will simply translate each problem into a system of linear equations,
      using steps 1-4 from the list of strategies above.
      We will not worry about solving these problems.

        What does the wife earn?

              The two angles are supplementary angles,

              This gives us our second equation:

              The perimeter of the rectangular pool is <m>68</m> yards.

        This will give us our two equations:

        <p permid="znG">
          Notah made some large purchases with his two credit cards one month and took on a total of
          <m>\$8{,}400</m> in debt from the two cards.
          He didn't make any payments the first month,
          so the two credit card debts each started to accrue interest.
          That month, his Visa card charged <m>2\%</m> interest and his Mastercard charged <m>2.5\%</m> interest.
          Because of this, Notah's total debt grew by <m>\$178</m>.
          How much money did Notah charge to each card?
        </p>
      </statement>
      <solution permid="Lgm">
        <p permid="QsV">
          To start, we will define two variables based on our two unknowns.
          Let <m>v</m> be the amount charged to the Visa card
          (in dollars)
          and let <m>m</m> be the amount charged to the Mastercard
          (in dollars).
        </p>
        <p permid="wAe">
          To determine our equations, notice that we are given two different totals.
          We will use these to form our two equations.
          The total amount charged is <m>\$8{,}400</m> so we have:
          <me permid="qSj">
            (v\,\text{dollars})+(m\,\text{dollars})=\$8400
          </me>
          Or without units:
          <me permid="WZs">
            v+m=8400
          </me>
          The other total we were given is the total amount of interest,
          <m>\$178</m>, which is also in dollars.
          The Visa had <m>v</m> dollars charged to it and accrues <m>2\%</m> interest.
          So <m>0.02v</m> is the dollar amount of interest that comes from using this card.
          Similarly, <m>0.025m</m> is the dollar amount of interest from using the Mastercard.
          Together:
          <me permid="DgB">
            0.02(v\,\text{dollars})+0.025(m\,\text{dollars})=\$178
          </me>
          Or without units:
          <me permid="jnK">
            0.02v+0.025m=178
          </me>
          As a system, we write:
          <me permid="PuT">
            \left\{ \begin{alignedat}{3} v\amp+{}\amp m\amp={}8400 \\ 0.02v\amp+{}\amp 0.025m\amp{}=178 \\ \end{alignedat} \right.
          </me>
        </p>
        <p permid="cHn">
          To solve this system by substitution,
          notice that it will be easier to solve for one of the variables in the first equation.
          We'll solve that equation for <m>v</m>:
          <md permid="QOH">
            <mrow>v+m\amp=8400</mrow>
 <!-- <mrow>v+m\subtractright{m}\amp=8400\subtractright{m}</mrow> -->
            <mrow>v\amp=8400-m</mrow>
          </md>
          Now we will substitute <m>8400-m</m> for <m>v</m> in the second equation:
          <md permid="wVQ">
            <mrow>0.02v+0.025m\amp=178</mrow>
            <mrow>0.02(\substitute{8400-m})+0.025m\amp=178</mrow>
            <mrow>168-0.02m+0.025m\amp=178</mrow>
            <mrow>168+0.005m\amp=178</mrow>
            <mrow>0.005m\amp=10</mrow>
            <mrow>\divideunder{0.005m}{0.005}\amp=\divideunder{10}{0.005}</mrow>
            <mrow>m\amp=2000</mrow>
          </md>
          Lastly, we can determine the value of <m>v</m> by using the earlier equation where we isolated <m>v</m>:
          <md permid="dcZ">
            <mrow>v\amp=8400-m</mrow>
            <mrow>v\amp=8400-\substitute{2000}</mrow>
            <mrow>v\amp=6400</mrow>
          </md>
        </p>
        <p permid="IOw">
          In summary, Notah charged <m>\$6400</m> to the Visa and <m>\$2000</m> to the Mastercard.
          We should check that these numbers work as solutions to our original system <em>and</em>
          that they make sense in context.
          (For instance, if one of these numbers were negative,
          or was something small like <m>\$0.50</m>,
          they wouldn't make sense as credit card debt.)
        </p>
      </solution>
